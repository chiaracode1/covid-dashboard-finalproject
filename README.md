# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This project is the final project of the [start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it/)'s master.

# Technical requirements

- Dashboard reporting global COVID-19 data
- Any graphic elements
- Dedicated page with data for each Usa state
- Simple and easy to use UI and UX
- Organized and understandable app structure

# Idea 

I chose the project on the covid data report because it was very close to my degree thesis in which I described how covid data was managed in Italy and in the electronic health record.
